# File Handling in Python: count the frequency of each character in it

## 🎯 Aim
Write a Python program to read a file and count the frequency of each character in it
## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Open the file  in **read mode**.
2. Define a function 'char_frequency' to count the frequency of each character in it.
3. allow the user to test the function return the output
