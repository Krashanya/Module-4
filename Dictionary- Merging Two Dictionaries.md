## Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## 🎯 Aim
Write a python program to merge the dictionary1 with dictionary2
## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Merge the two dictionaries using the update function
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3.Print the merged dictionary.
